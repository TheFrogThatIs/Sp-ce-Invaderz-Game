# Sp@ce Invaderz Game
A browser-hosted, PC-based, 3D Space Shooter game developed using the PlayCanvas game engine. 

(Game is pretty work-intensive, don't recommend playing on a slow computer)

**Description:**
Sp@ce Invaderz is a web application video game that centers around space combat with various enemies. The player, who will spawn in as a spacecraft, will get to freely explore several space environments while encountering enemies. The primary goal of the player is to eliminate a certain number of enemies which will take the form of spacecrafts and land-based aliens, with a final boss in the last level. Additionally, the player must collect resources: oxygen and fuel in order to survive, as well as space currency to purchase new ships & blasters. The playerâ€™s resources will deplete over time, so they will have to gather resources through in-game interactions. If at any point the resources fully deplete, the player will die and the game will end. 

There are a total of three levels with different terrains and different enemies, however, the objective of eliminating enemies remains the same. The first level takes place in outer space with enemy spacecrafts. The second level takes place on a fictional alien planet with land-based enemies. The third and final level takes place near another fictional alien planet with spacecrafts and land-based enemies and a giant space monster.
